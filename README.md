DataAppUsingADONet2
===================

Two ways to implement data applications: Dragging from data source and ADO.Net

In this app you will find two groups of components: 

A data view grid.
A binding navigator.
A set of tex boxes/labes that shows the row selected on data grid.

Both groups manages a set of users, the op one is implemented usig a datasource, anda draging components from this data source
to the form.
The secon one acts as the same way but in a programatically manner.
